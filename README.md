# Chaos in Double Pendulum

## Abstract

We have known the double pendulum as a system that proves to be both theoretically and experimentally rich, despite its simplicity with only two moving parts and two axles. Our experiments focused on exploring different faces of the systemâ€™s linear and nonlinear behaviour. Key parameters under scrutiny include the normal mode frequencies ($\omega_{1,2}$) in the linear mode and the Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda$) related to the chaos of the double pendulum. We obtained the normal mode frequencies closely following the analytically predicted normal mode frequencies. We also obtained a positive Lyapunov exponent indicating definite chaos in the double pendulum.
